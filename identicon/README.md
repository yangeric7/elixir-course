# Identicon

This elixir program generates an identicon, essentially the github profile picture you get when you create a new account.
This program helped me learn a lot of elixir syntax, practice more pattern matching, and overall idea of functional programming.

[Install Elixir Here](https://elixir-lang.org/install.html)

Get Dependencies with `mix deps.get`

Elixir Interactive Shell with `iex -S mix`

Generate an Identicon with `Identicon.main(<your string here>)`

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `identicon` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:identicon, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can
be found at [https://hexdocs.pm/identicon](https://hexdocs.pm/identicon).
